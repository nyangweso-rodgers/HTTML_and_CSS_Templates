# `%` Unit

# Description

- Percentages are relative units that render an element relative to the size of the element's parent. They serve as a percentage of their containing block and are always relative to their nearest parent.

* `%` - Relative to `1%` of the parent element

- Remarks
  - When you want an element to take up a certain amount of the containing block, then you should go with **percentages**.
  - Percentages can be used for positioning elements relative to their containing element. This comes in handy when creating layouts where elements need to be positioned based on a percentage of the parent.
  - Setting widths and heights in percentages also allows elements to scale relative to their containing element.
