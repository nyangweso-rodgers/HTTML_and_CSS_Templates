# `vh` (Viewport Height) css unit

# Description

- `vh` is a relative unit of measurement that represents the visible height area of the browser window.
- - `vh` is Relative to `1%` of the viewport's height.
- If we take `1vh` that means we take `1%` of the browser's height...
- `vh`/`vw` (`viewport height`/`width`): These units are based on the size of the `viewport` and are particularly useful for achieving fluid layouts that adapt to different screen sizes. `vh` and `vw` units are commonly used for setting `font sizes`, `padding`, and `margin` when you want elements to scale proportionally with the viewport dimensions. They are especially suitable for full-height or full-width elements.
- **Remarks**:
  - Using vh for height allows elements to maintain the set height of the viewport. This is particularly useful when you want an element to take up a certain percentage of the screen's height.
  - `vh` can also be used to set font sizes that are responsive to the viewport height. This is useful for responsive typography. When you don't want an element to be relative to the parent, you can use `vh`.
