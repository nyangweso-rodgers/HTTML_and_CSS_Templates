# `px` Unit

# Description

- `px` is an **absolute unit** of measurement used to specify length and sizes. `px` is a fixed unit and should be used sparingly and with caution for responsive design.
- `1px` = 1/96th of 1 inch (96px = 1 inch)
- A pixel is the smallest unit of an image on a screen.
- `1px` is equal to one dot on the screen, so specifying a `width` or `height` of `100px` will result in a 100-pixel-wide or 100-pixel-high element.

- **Remarks**:
  - `px` is useful when you want to specify a fixed size of an element, such as a **border size** or an **image size**.
