## Table of Contents

# CSS Units

- **CSS Unit** determines the size of a property you are setting for an element of its content.

# Absolute Units

- Units that are "**absolute**" are the same size regardless of the parent element or window size.

  | Unit | Description            |
  | ---- | ---------------------- |
  | `pt` | 1pt = 1/72th of 1 inch |
  | `mm` | 1mm = 1/10th of 1cm    |
  | `cm` | Centimeters            |
  | `pc` | 12pt = 1pc             |
  | `in` | inches                 |

# Relative Units

- **Relative units** are useful for styling responsive sites because they scale `relative` to the parent or window size (depending upon the unit)

  | Unit   | Description                                                         | Use Case |
  | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- |
  | `vmin` | Relative to the viewport's smaller dimension, 1vmin = max(1vh, 1vw) |
  | `vmax` | Relative to the viewport's larger dimension, vmax = max(1vh, 1vw)   |
  | `ch`   | Relative to the width of the glyph "O" of the element's font        |
