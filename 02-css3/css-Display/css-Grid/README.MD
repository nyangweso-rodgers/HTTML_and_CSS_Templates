# CSS Grid vs CSS Flexbox
* While  `Flexbox` helps with _one dimensional arrangement of elements_,  `CSS grid` is able to do _two dimensional arrangements_. i.e., `Flexbox`, allows you to either arrange elements _horizontally_ (in a row) or _vertically_ (in a column). But with `CSS Grid` you can align elements both _vertically and horizontally_.

# `Flex Container` vs. `Flex Item`
* `Flex Items` are the direct children of of a `flex container`.
