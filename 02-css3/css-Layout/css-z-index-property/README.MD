# CSS Layout - `z-index` Property

* The `z-index` property specifies the stack order of an element, (which element should be placed in front of, or behind, the others).
* An element can have a positive or negative stack order:
* __NOTE__: `z-index `only works on `positioned` elements (`position: absolute`, `position: relative`, `position: fixed`, or `position: sticky`) and `flex` items (elements that are direct children of `display: flex `elements).
