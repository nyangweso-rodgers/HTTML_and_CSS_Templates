# `rem` (Root Em) css unit

# Description

- `em` is not dependent on its parent's font size but is dependent on its root element meaning the `html` and `body` tags. i.e., all the things in `rem` are set according to the size of `body` tag.

- particularly useful for setting font sizes and overall layout proportions that adapt to different screen sizes. They provide a responsive design that adjusts to changes in the root font size.
