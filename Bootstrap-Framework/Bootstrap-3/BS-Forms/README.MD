# Bootstrap Forms

# Introduction to Bootstrap Forms
* Each Bootstrap form element should have a class _form-control_. This class is how Bootstrap knows which elements to style. All textual elements like __input__, __textarea__ and __select__ that have the _form-control_ class will have 100% width by default.

* There are two types of Bootstrap forms, which are:
    1. __Inline form__ - creates the form on a single line. Useful for login forms in a nav bar

    2. __Horizontal form__ - creates a form with each element in a different row

# Form Inputs
* Bootstrap supports the following form controls:
    1. input
    2. textarea
    3. checkbox
    4. radio
    5. select
    6. range

# Form Input 1: Input
* __Bootstrap__ supports all the HTML5 input types: text, password, datetime, datetime-local, date, month, time, week, number, email, url, search, tel, and color.

* __Note: Inputs will NOT be fully styled if their type is not properly declared!__

# Form Input 2: Checkboxes
* __Checkboxes__ are used if you want the user to select any number of options from a list of preset options.

# Form Input 3: Radio Buttons
* Radio buttons are used if you want to limit the user to just one selection from a list of preset options.

# Form Input 4: Select (List)
* Select lists are used if you want to allow the user to pick from multiple options.

# Form Input 5: Range
* Select lists are used if you want to allow the user to pick from multiple options.
