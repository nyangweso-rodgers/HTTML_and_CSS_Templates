# Bootstrap 5 Grid System
* Bootstrap's grid system is built with flexbox and allows up to 12 columns across the page.

# Grid Classes
* The Bootstrap 5 grid system has six classes:
    1. __.col__: (extra small devices - screen width less than 576px)
    2. __.col-sm__: (small devices - screen width equal to or greater than 576px)
    3. __.col-md__: (medium devices - screen width equal to or greater than 768px)
    4. __.col-lg__: (large devices - screen width equal to or greater than 992px)
    5. __.col-xl__: (xlarge devices - screen width equal to or greater than 1200px)
    6. __.col-xxl__: (xxlarge devices - screen width equal to or greater than 1400px)

* The classes above can be combined to create more dynamic and flexible layouts.

* __Tip__: _Each class scales up, so if you want to set the same widths for sm and md, you only need to specify sm._
