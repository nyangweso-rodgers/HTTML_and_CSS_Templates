# Nav Menus
* If you want to create a simple horizontal menu, add the __.nav__ class to a < ul > element, followed by __.nav-item__ for each < li > and add the __.nav-link__ class to their links:

# Aligned Nav
* Add the __.justify-content-center__ class to center the nav, and the __.justify-content-end__ class to right-align the nav.
