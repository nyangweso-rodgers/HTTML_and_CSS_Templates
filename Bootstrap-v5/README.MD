# Introduction to Bootstrap 5
* [Bootstrap 5](https://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap5/index.php) (released in 2021) is the newest version of [Bootstrap](https://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap/default.asp) (released in 2013); with new components, faster stylesheets, more responsiveness etc. It supports the latest, stable releases of all major browsers and platforms. However, Internet Explorer 11 and down is not supported.

* The main differences between Bootstrap 5 and Bootstrap 3 & 4, is that Bootstrap 5 has switched to __JavaScript__ instead of __jQuery__git.

# Available breakpoints
* Bootstrap includes six default breakpoints, sometimes referred to as grid tiers, for building responsively.

  Breakpoint | Class infix | Dimensions
  | -------  | ----------- | ---------|
  X-Small | None | 0 -576px
  Small | sm | >= 576px
  Medium | md | >= 768px
  Large | lg | >= 992px
  Extra Large | xl | >= 1200px
  Extra extra large | xxl | >= 1400px

* Each breakpoint size was chosen to be a multiple of 12 and to be representative of a subset of common device sizes and viewport dimensions. They donâ€™t specifically target every use case or device, but the provide ranges provide a strong and consistent foundation to build on for nearly any device.
