# Bootstrap 5 css grid


# Bootstrap 5 Grid System
* __Bootstrap’s grid system__ uses a series of `containers`, `rows`, and `columns` to layout and align content. It’s built with `flexbox` and is fully responsive.

# Responsive Classes
# All Breakpoints
* For grids that are the same from the smallest of devices to the largest, use the `.col `and `.col-*` classes. Specify a numbered class when you need a particularly sized column; otherwise, feel free to stick to `.col`.

# Stacked to horizontal
* Using a single set of `.col-sm-*` classes, you can create a basic grid system that starts out stacked and becomes horizontal at the small breakpoint (`sm`).
