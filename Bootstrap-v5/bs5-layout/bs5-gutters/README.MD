* __Gutters__ are the padding between your columns, used to responsively space and align content in the Bootstrap grid system.

# How gutters work
* __Gutters are the gaps between column content, created by horizontal__ `padding`. We set `padding-right` and `padding-left` on each column, and use negative `margin` to offset that at the start and end of each row to align content.

* __Gutters start at__ `1.5rem` (`24px`) wide.

* __Gutters can be responsively adjusted.__ Use breakpoint-specific gutter classes to modify horizontal gutters, vertical gutters, and all gutters.
