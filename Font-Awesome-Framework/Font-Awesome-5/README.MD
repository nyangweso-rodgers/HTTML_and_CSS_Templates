# Overview Of Font Awesome 5

* Font Awesome 5 has a PRO edition with 7842 icons, and a FREE edition with 1588 icons.

* To use the Free Font Awesome 5 icons, you can choose to download the Font Awesome library, or you can sign up for an account at Font Awesome, and get a code (called KIT CODE) to use when you add Font Awesome to your web page.

* We prefer the KIT CODE approach. Once you get the code you can start using Font Awesome on your web pages by including only one line of HTML code:

    ```html
        <script src="https://kit.fontawesome.com/yourcode.js" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
        <script src="https://kit.fontawesome.com/592084ced4.js" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
    ```

# New in Font Awesome 5
* New in Font Awesome 5 is the __fas__ prefix, Font Awesome 4 uses __fa__.

* The __s__ in __fas__ stands for __solid__, and some icons also have a regular mode, specified by using the prefix __far__:

* Font Awesome is designed to be used with inline elements. The __< i >__ and __< span >__ elements are widely used for icons.

* Also note that if you change the font-size or color of the icon's container, the icon changes. Same things goes for shadow, and anything else that gets inherited using CSS.

# Sizing Icons
* The __fa-xs__, __fa-sm__, __fa-lg__, __fa-2x__, __fa-3x__, __fa-4x__,__fa-5x__, __fa-6x__, __fa-7x__, __fa-8x__, __fa-9x__, or __fa-10x__ classes are used to adjust the icon sizes relative to their container.

# List Icons
* The __fa-ul__ and __fa-li__ classes are used to replace default bullets in unordered lists.

# Animated Icons
* The __fa-spin__ class gets any icon to rotate, and the __fa-pulse__ class gets any icon to rotate with 8 steps.

# Rotated and Flipped Icons
* The __fa-rotate-*__ and __fa-flip-*__ classes are used to rotate and flip icons.

# Stacked Icons
* To stack multiple icons, use the __fa-stack__ class on the parent, the __fa-stack-1x__ class for the regularly sized icon, and __fa-stack-2x__ for the larger icon.

* The __fa-inverse__ class can be used as an alternative icon color. You can also add larger icon classes to the parent to further control the sizing.

# Fixed Width Icons
* Just like letters and other characters, icons can have different widths, and if you need to vertically align icons like in a list or a menu, this can be a problem.

* The __fa-fw__ class is used to set icons at a fixed width.

# Bordered and Pulled Icons
* The __fa-border__, __fa-pull-right__ or __fa-pull-left__ classes are used for pull quotes or article icons.
