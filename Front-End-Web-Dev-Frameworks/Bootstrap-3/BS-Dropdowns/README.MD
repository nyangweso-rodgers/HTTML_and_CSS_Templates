# Dropdowns

* Bootstrap provides Dropdowns as a plugin for displaying lists of links. A dropdown is a button which toggles displaying a list of links.

* Bootstrap’s dropdowns are designed to be generic and applicable to a variety of situations. For instance, it is possible to create dropdowns that contain search fields or login forms.

* The __.dropdown__ class indicates a dropdown menu.
* To open the dropdown menu, use a button or a link with a class of __.dropdown-toggle__ and the __data-toggle="dropdown__ attribute.

* The __.caret__ class creates a caret arrow icon (▼), which indicates that the button is a dropdown.

* Add the __.dropdown-menu__ class to a unordered list element to actually build the dropdown menu.
