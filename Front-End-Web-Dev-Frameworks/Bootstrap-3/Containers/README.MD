# Containers
* Bootstrap requires a containing element to wrap site contents. There are two container classes to choose from:
    1. The __.container__ class provides a responsive __fixed width container__.
    2. The __.container-fluid__ class provides a __full width container__, spanning the entire width of the viewport
