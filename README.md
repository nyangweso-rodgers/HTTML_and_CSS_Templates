# Different Types of Websites
# Type 1: Static Website
* Made of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
* We have to upload HTML pages to CDN to host them on the web and whenever we request those pages in a browser it would return them to us.
* So for every new page, we made a new request to the server.

# Type 2: Single Page Applications (SPA)
* Based on the concept of __Client-Side Rendering__.
* A __single-page application__ is an app that works inside a browser.
* __SPAs__ are structured as a single HTML page that has no preloaded content.
* Content is loaded via Javascript files for the entire application and housed within a single HTML page.
* Only a single server request was made for the initial empty HTML page.
* Everything else (routing, data) is handled by the SPA in the browser.
* Typical React/ Vue applications come under this category.

# Type 3: Server-Side Rendering
* `HTML` pages are built on the server-side after every page request.
* Server gets the data from various sources like databases, aggregates them into template files, and then sends the resulting HTML file back to the browser.
* `PHP` or `Nodejs` with templating engines like `EJS`, `jade`, `hbs` comes under this category.
