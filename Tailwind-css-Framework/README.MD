# Introduction to Tailwind CSS
* __Tailwind CSS__ is a "utility-first CSS framework" which provides several of these opinionated, single-purpose utility classes that you can use directly inside your markup to design an element.

* You can get a list of all the utility classes __Tailwind__ has to offer from the [documentation page](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation). Also if you are working in __VS Code__, you can install an extension called [Tailwind CSS IntelliSense](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bradlc.vscode-tailwindcss) and it will give you auto-suggestions as you keep typing the utility classes.

# How to Set Up Tailwind CSS
* Tailwind CSS works smoothly with a plethora of frameworks like _Next_, _React_, _Angular_, and more â€“ and even our OG HTML.

# Installation Guide 1: Play CDN
* Use the __Play CDN__ to try Tailwind right in the browser without any build step. The __Play CDN__ is designed for development purposes only, and is not the best choice for production.

    ```html
        <head>
            <!-- Add the Play CDN script to your HTML -->
            <script src="https://cdn.tailwindcss.com"></script>
        </head>
    ```
