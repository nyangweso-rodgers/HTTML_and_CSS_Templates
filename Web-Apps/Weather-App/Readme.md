# Description
* We create a Weather Application with `html`, `css`, `Bootstrap 5`, and `javascript`.

# API
* We get data from [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/) API.
* To use the API, we need an API key.

# Steps
* Step 1: Head to [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/) API and get an API Key
* Step 2: Create an event listener that will fire up when the page loads. So, the event we are looking for is load here. And when the page loads, it will execute some function that we define.

    ```js
        window.addEventListener("load", () => {} );
    ```
