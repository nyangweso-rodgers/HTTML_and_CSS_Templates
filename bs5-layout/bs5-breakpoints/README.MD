# Available breakpoints
* Bootstrap includes six default breakpoints, sometimes referred to as grid tiers, for building responsively.

Breakpoint | Class infix | Dimensions
| -------  | ----------- | ---------|
X-Small | None | 0 -576px
Small | sm | >= 576px
Medium | md | >= 768px
Large | lg | >= 992px
Extra Large | xl | >= 1200px
Extra extra large | xxl | >= 1400px

* Each breakpoint size was chosen to be a multiple of 12 and to be representative of a subset of common device sizes and viewport dimensions. They donâ€™t specifically target every use case or device, but the provide ranges provide a strong and consistent foundation to build on for nearly any device.
