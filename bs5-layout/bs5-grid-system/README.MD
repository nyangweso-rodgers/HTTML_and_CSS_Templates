* Grid is a powerful system for building mobile-first layout.
* We use __.col-md-*__ to create a column, where * specifies the number of columns between 1 and 12.
* __md__ specifies the breakpoint where the columns change its width.
* __md__ means "__screen â‰¥768px__", e.g., the columns will stretch to 100% of the width on the screens smaller or equal 768px.
