# Position `relative`

* An element with a `relative` position is positioned relative to its normal position.
* Setting the `top`, `right`, `bottom`, and `left` properties of a `relatively-positioned` element will cause it to be adjusted away from its normal position. Other content will not be adjusted to fit into any gap left by the element.
