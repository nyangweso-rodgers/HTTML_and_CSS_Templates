# Position: `sticky`
* An element with `position: sticky;` is positioned based on the user's scroll position.

* A sticky element toggles between `relative` and `fixed`, depending on the scroll position. It is positioned relative until a given offset position is met in the viewport - then it "sticks" in place (like position:fixed).
