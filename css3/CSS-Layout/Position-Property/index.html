            <h3>1. Position: static;</h3>
            <p>An element with <b>position: static;</b> is not positioned in any special way; it is always positioned according to the normal flow of the page:</p>
            <div class="static">
                This element has position: static;
            </div>

            <h3>2: Position: relative</h3>
            <p>An element with position: relative; is positioned relative to its normal position:</p>
            <div class="relative">This div element has position: relative;</div>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h3>3: Position: fixed;</h3>
            <p>An element with position: fixed; is positioned relative to the viewport, which means it always stays in the same place even if the page is scrolled:</p>

            <h3>4. Position: absolute;</h3>
            <p>An element with position: absolute; is positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor (instead of positioned relative to the viewport, like fixed):</p>
            <div class="relative-position"> This div element has position: relative;
                <div class="absolute">This div element has position: absolute;</div>
