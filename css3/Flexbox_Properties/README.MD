# Introduction to CSS Flexbox
* "__One-dimensionally__" means __Flexbox__ allows laying out __box models__ in a row or column at a time. i.e., __Flexbox__ cannot lay out box models in a row and column at the same time.

* __flex__ tells browsers to display the selected HTML element as a block-level flexible box model.
# CSS Grid vs CSS Flexbox
* The main difference is that while __Flexbox__ helps with _one dimensional arrangement of elements_, __CSS grid__ is able to do _two dimensional arrangements_. i.e., __Flexbox__, allows you to either arrange elements _horizontally_ (in a row) or _vertically_ (in a column). But with __CSS Grid__ you can align elements both _vertically and horizontally_.

# Flex Container vs. Flex Item
* __Flex Items__ are the direct children of of a __flex container__.
