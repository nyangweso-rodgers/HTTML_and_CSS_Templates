# `vh` (Viewport Height) css unit

# Description
* `vh` is Relative to `1%` of the viewport's height.
* If we take `1vh` that means we take `1%` of the browser's height...
* `vh`/`vw` (`viewport height`/`width`): These units are based on the size of the `viewport` and are particularly useful for achieving fluid layouts that adapt to different screen sizes. `vh` and `vw` units are commonly used for setting `font sizes`, ``padding``, and `margin` when you want elements to scale proportionally with the viewport dimensions. They are especially suitable for full-height or full-width elements.
