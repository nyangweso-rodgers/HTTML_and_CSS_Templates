# bootstrap 5 - carousels

# attributes
* `data-bs-ride="carousel"` attribute is used to initialize the Bootstrap carousel component. It tells `Bootstrap` to automatically initialize the carousel when the page loads.

    * The `data-bs-ride` attribute is specific to `Bootstrap 5` and is used in conjunction with the `carousel` component.
    * When Bootstrap detects an element with the `data-bs-ride="carousel"` attribute, it will automatically enable the carousel functionality, allowing you to navigate through slides or cards using the carousel indicators, navigation arrows, or by swiping (on touch-enabled devices).
